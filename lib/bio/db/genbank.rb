  # DEFINITION  - A concise description of the sequence. Mandatory
  #  keyword/one or more records.
  #
  # There is no limit on the number of lines that may be part of the
  # DEFINITION. The last line must end with a period.
  #
  #  - DEFINITION Format for NLM Entries
  #
  #   The first part of the definition line contains information
  # describing the genes and proteins represented by the molecular
  # sequences.  This can be gene locus names, protein names and
  # descriptions that replace or augment actual names.  Gene and gene
  # product are linked by "=".  Any special identifying terms are
  # presented within brackets, such as: {promoter}, {N-terminal}, {EC
  # 2.13.2.4}, {alternatively spliced}, or {3' region}.
  #
  #   The second part of the definition line is delimited by square
  # brackets, '[]', and provides details about the molecule type and
  # length.  The biological source, i.e., genus and species or common
  # name as cited by the author.  Developmental stage, tissue type and
  # strain are included if available.  The molecule types include:
  # Genomic, mRNA, Peptide. and Other Genomic Material. Genomic
  # molecules are assumed to be partial sequence unless "Complete" is
  # specified, whereas mRNA and peptide molecules are assumed to be
  # complete unless "Partial" is noted.

  # ACCESSION  - The primary accession number is a unique, unchanging
  #  code assigned to each entry. (Please use this code when citing
  #  information from GenBank.) Mandatory keyword/one or more records.
  #
  #   This field contains a series of six-character and/or eight-character
  # identifiers called 'accession numbers'. The six-character accession
  # number format consists of a single uppercase letter, followed by 5 digits.
  # The eight-character accession number format consists of two uppercase
  # letters, followed by 6 digits. The 'primary', or first, of the accession
  # numbers occupies positions 13 to 18 (6-character format) or positions
  # 13 to 20 (8-character format). Subsequent 'secondary' accession numbers
  # (if present) are separated from the primary, and from each other, by a
  # single space. In some cases, multiple lines of secondary accession
  # numbers might be present, starting at position 13.

  # VERSION  - A compound identifier consisting of the primary
  #  accession number and a numeric version number associated with the
  #  current version of the sequence data in the record. This is
  #  followed by an integer key (a "GI") assigned to the sequence by
  #  NCBI.  Mandatory keyword/exactly one record.
  #
  # Accession.Version system : replacement for NID(gi) and PID(/db_xref)
  #
  #  - Compound Accession Number
  #
  # A compound accession number consists of two parts: a stable,
  # unchanging primary-accession number portion, and a sequentially
  # increasing numeric version number.  The accession and version
  # numbers are separated by a period. The initial version number
  # assigned to a new sequence is one. Compound accessions are often
  # referred to as "Accession.Version".
  #
  #  - NCBI GI identifier
  #
  # The NCBI GI identifier of the VERSION line also serves as a method
  # for identifying the sequence data that has existed for a database
  # entry over time. GI identifiers are numeric values of one or more
  # digits. Since they are integer keys, they are less human-friendly
  # than the Accession.Version system described above. Returning to
  # our example for AF181452, it was initially assigned GI 6017929. If
  # the sequence changes, a new integer GI will be assigned, perhaps
  # 7345003 . And after the second sequence change, perhaps the GI
  # would become 10456892.

  # NID  - An alternative method of presenting the NCBI GI identifier
  #  (described above). The NID is obsolete and was removed from the
  #  GenBank flatfile format in December 1999.
  #
  # In maintaining GenBank, NCBI generates a new gi if a sequence has changed.
  #

  # KEYWORDS  - Short phrases describing gene products and other
  #  information about an entry. Mandatory keyword in all annotated
  #  entries/one or more records.
  #
  # The KEYWORDS field does not appear in unannotated entries, but is
  # required in all annotated entries. Keywords are separated by
  # semicolons; a "keyword" may be a single word or a phrase
  # consisting of several words. Each line in the keywords field ends
  # in a semicolon; the last line ends with a period. If no keywords
  # are included in the entry, the KEYWORDS record contains only a
  # period.

  # SEGMENT  - Information on the order in which this entry appears in
  #  a series of discontinuous sequences from the same molecule.
  #  Optional keyword (only in segmented entries)/exactly one record.
  #
  # The SEGMENT keyword is used when two (or more) entries of known
  # relative orientation are separated by a short (<10 kb) stretch of DNA.
  # It is limited to one line of the form `n of m', where `n' is the
  # segment number of the current entry and `m' is the total number of
  # segments.

  #  entries/one or more records/includes one subkeyword.
  #
  #   ORGANISM  - Formal scientific name of the organism (first line)
  #    and taxonomic classification levels (second and subsequent
  #    lines).  Mandatory subkeyword in all annotated entries/two or
  #    more records.
  #
  # The SOURCE field consists of two parts. The first part is found
  # after the SOURCE keyword and contains free-format information
  # including an abbreviated form of the organism name followed by a
  # molecule type; multiple lines are allowed, but the last line must
  # end with a period.  The second part consists of information found
  # after the ORGANISM subkeyword. The formal scientific name for the
  # source organism (genus and species, where appropriate) is found on
  # the same line as ORGANISM.  The records following the ORGANISM
  # line list the taxonomic classification levels, separated by
  # semicolons and ending with a period.
